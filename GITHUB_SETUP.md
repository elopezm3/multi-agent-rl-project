# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## 🚀 Creating Your GitHub Repository

### 1. Create New Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Repository name: `multi-agent-rl-portfolio`
5. Description: `Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Coordinated Package Delivery with 78%+ Success Rate`
6. Make it **Public** (for portfolio visibility)
7. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)
8. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Initialize Local Git Repository
```bash
cd multi-agent-rl-portfolio
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Multi-agent RL portfolio project"
```

### 3. Connect to GitHub Repository
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/multi-agent-rl-portfolio.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 📁 Repository Structure

Your GitHub repository will have this clean structure:

```
