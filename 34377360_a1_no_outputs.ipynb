    "# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Coordinated Package Delivery\n",

    "## 🎯 Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project implements a multi-agent reinforcement learning system where 4 agents learn to coordinate package delivery in a 5×5 grid world. The challenge involves agents picking up packages from location A and delivering them to location B while avoiding collisions, all within a 1.5M step training limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Achievement**: Achieved **78%+ success rate** (exceeding the 75% target) using a novel staged training approach."

    "## 🎯 Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Train 4 agents in a 5×5 grid world to learn a coordinated transport task:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 **Performance Constraints**\n",
    "- **Step Budget**: 1,500,000 maximum agent steps during training\n",
    "- **Collision Budget**: 4,000 maximum head-on collisions during training  \n",
    "- **Walltime Budget**: 10 minutes maximum runtime for training\n",
    "- **Final Performance**: 75% success rate across all scenarios\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Each agent must complete delivery in ≤25 steps\n",
    "- **Safety**: All deliveries must be collision-free\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Challenge Requirements**\n",
    "- **Objective**: Pick up packages from location A and deliver to location B\n",
    "- **Constraint**: Avoid collisions between agents\n",
    "- **Evaluation**: Test across all possible A-B-agent combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Key Innovation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Staged Training Approach**: Instead of training all 4 agents simultaneously, we train a single agent across diverse scenarios, then deploy the learned policy to multiple agents. This approach achieves emergent collision avoidance through natural path differentiation."

    "## Methodology\n",
    "This challenge is solved by using a \"Staged Training\".\n",
    "\n",
    "After many different strategies to reach the desired performance, the best training method found was to train a single agent in the most possible number of scenarios (A and B in different locations) resetting each scenario every 100 steps, while giving some rewards to the agent based on its behaviour (see Rewards section). So all the training consists in a single agent in the 1.500.000 steps learning the best possible path from A to B and from B to A. The interesting point about this is how in most scenarios the agent takes a different path from A to B than from B to A, which makes the collisions do not occur when placing the 4 agents, this keypoint will be analysed further on."

    "All rewards previously defined are really self-explanatory by themselves. The only interesting point is that the collision penalty has value of 0. This is because during our training we are only using a single agent so it is not possible that there exists a collision. In fact, this collision penalty could have any value and it would not affect our training. The only reason why it is defined is case another another stage is implemented into the training with more than one agent and therefore we would need to adjust this value."

    "\n",
    "Something important to highlight here, is how the relation between exploration/exploitation (epsilon start, end and decay values) and the rest of the hyperparameters were chosen. Initially the idea was to be conservative, with a low epsilon from the start (0.3) and to reach the minimum value (0.1) at approximately 1.000.000 steps (66% of the training). For this, we simply did some basic algebra knowing that E_min = E_start * E_decay^N with N as the number of steps, and found E_decay which after this calculation was 0.9999989. The learning rate was initially set to 0.1 because it is a commonly used setting in Q learning which allows our agent to learn without changing the Q values too aggresive or too slow. The discount factor was initially set as 0.99 since our agents need to learn a path so it is important  for them to prioritize future rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "After some iterations with these initial values, the only one that changed was E_decay = 0.999999 which gave us the best performance."

    "In the training metrics plotting we can see, the rewards and the deliveries per step increase over time. We observe that we are reaching a value of between 0.15 and 0.2 deliveries per step, which means that every 5 to 7 steps there is a delivery. This is a good sign since for our desired performance, an agent should take approx 25 steps to make a delivery, which considering that we have 4 agents, could result in having a delivery in 100 steps, and we are way below this value.\n",

    "The final performance evaluation shows that the agents with no training (random-naive) have a succesful rate of less than 1%, while our trained agents have a sucess rate of more than 78% which meets the target of 75%.\n",
    "\n",
    "We definetely significantly improved in all the metrics by training our agents. It is interesting how the scenarios that are failing because of timeouts for our training agents is 0, which is the expected behaviour since the single agent training allowed them to learn effective paths between A and B, so the only reason why our agents fail is because they collide.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is most interesting out of everything is how our agents do not collide in more than 78% of the scenarios, when collisions were not considered during the training. This is a very interesting fact and after visualizing some cases and reasoning about it I found the reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "When visualizing the behaviour of the agents, agents from A to B in most cases would choose a different path than from B to A. The Q table in its last dimension has 4 possible values (4 actions: 0: up, 1: down, 2: left and 3: right), so when we do action_idx = np.argmax(q_values) for choosing the action it may change the returned action depending on the current position. This is because let's say agent \"0\" is in A (0,0) while agent \"1\" is in B (1,1), for agent \"0\" going right or down have the same best q-value, but since \"down\" is first in the q-table, it will tell the agent to go down, while agent \"1\" has the best q-value when going \"up\" or \"left\", but since \"up\" is first in the q-table, then it will tell the agent to take this direction. So basically the solution works well because of how the order of actions is defined, if i changed it to let's say (0: down, 2: left, 3:up, 4: right) then my agents would definetely always collide\n",

    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "From the last paragraph in the previous section we can infer why we still have around 20% of cases where the agents collide and many of them are when A and B are in the same row or column, because in this case there is indeed only one best path from A to B and it is the same that from B to A. The percentage of cases where A and B are aligned is 17%, which is close to our 20% of our failed cases, so definetely unless we add another training stage for these cases where the agents somehow learn to take different paths depending on the direction, we will not be able to reach more than 83% of success. Let's visualize some of these cases to prove that those are the cases where our agents our colliding."
